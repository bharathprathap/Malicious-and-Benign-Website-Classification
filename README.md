# Malicious-and-Benign-Website-Classification
This project classifies and detects malicious websites  by  analyzing  various  factors  such  as  the  URL  of  the  website,  IP  address,  the geographic location of where the website is hosted and other factors.

The advancement in technology has opened up a new world, where all of our day-to-day activities such as banking, shopping, socialising etc happen in a virtual cyberspace. This also opens up an opportunity for more cybercrimes and hence it is imperative to have methods to protect an internet user from various threats like phishing, link spamming, redirection spamming and DNS spoofing.Hence this project focuses on increasing internet users' security online by implementing a system that classifies websites into malicious and benign . A website is classified as malicious based on application layer and network layer characteristics .
